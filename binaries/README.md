# Binaries

The ``master`` branch only contains licensing, readme and binaries -- if you
need access to release source code then these bundles are at:

And if you more specifically are looking to work with code, then look at:

  https://github.com/unserializable/monchester/branches

* Windows binaries for version 1.0 provided by GÃ¼nther Simon of RWBC (https://rwbc-chess.de/)
